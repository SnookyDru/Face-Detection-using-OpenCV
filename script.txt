Cascade Classifier:

-proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones

-machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images

-To train, we need to extract the features from the image
--for this 'HAAR features' are used
---HAAR are like [convolutional kernels] (https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-convolution-kernels-simplified-f040cb307c37)
---<HAAR features image>
---Each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under the white rectangle from sum of pixels under the black rectangle
---in the form of delta = sum of white - sum of black
---<Delta image>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2oDd5kX3Wo)[4:03]

--Now, all possible sizes and locations of each kernel are used to calculate lots of features
---<features image>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2oDd5kX3Wo)[12:22]
---//Just imagine how much computation it needs? Even a 24x24 window results over 160000 features

--To solve this, they introduced the integral image
---basic intuition is that instead of calculating sum of all the pixels every time we save their precalculated sum in such a way that th calculation gets converted into just a 44 pixel thing. 
---for a detailed explaination watch this<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEJ71VlUmMQ>[4:45]
---this makes it super fast
---//i am speed??

--ok we have our features now but the question arises is that which feature is actually relevant in detecting a face 
---//For example, consider the image below. The top row shows two good features. The first feature selected seems to focus 
	on the property that the region of the eyes is often darker than the region of the nose and cheeks. The second feature 
	selected relies on the property that the eyes are darker than the bridge of the nose. But the same windows applied to 
	cheeks or any other place is irrelevant. So how do we select the best features out of 160000+ features?
